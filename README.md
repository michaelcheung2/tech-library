### Future to-do list
1. Request input validation at the beginning of each API route
2. Error handling (on both the UI and in the API)
3. Better naming in API endpoints (use nouns instead of verbs)
4. Code refactoring (i.e. move UI constants to a separate "config" component)
5. General UI improvements, and more sophisticated pagination controls
6. Better documentation
